<b> Image steganalysis using machine learning techinques </b>
Two different CNN models, efficientnetB7 and sequential, were tested for Project, both of which have different data preparation stages. Both models are available in the code, but the preferred model is sequential because, in my opinion, it is more understandable and accurate based on the explanations. It should be noted that this operation was performed on TPU for faster speed. The ALASKA dataset consists of 4 folders with the same images, including a Cover folder with the original and unencrypted images, and three other folders, each encrypted with different encryption methods in the order of JMIPOD, JUNIWARD, and UERD, plus a test folder for prediction whether encryption has been performed or not. Since the signal is stored in the DCT coefficients, I have shown cosine similarity and dissimilarity for all three folders in the image, as well as the DCT matrix.
